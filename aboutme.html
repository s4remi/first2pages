          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>
            ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am currently a student in the Khoury College of Computer
            Science at Northeastern University, San Francisco campus.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am hoping to graduate in 2024. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng in
            civil Engineering and AS in Mathematics. I am highly interested in
            most areas of computer science, with a particular interest in
            computer graphics such ase AR,VR, Visualization and Computer Vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to maintain my passion for computer graphics and pursue
            relevant job opportunities in the future. In addition to computer
            graphics, I am also interested in backend development technologies
            such as distributed systems and networking.
          </p>
